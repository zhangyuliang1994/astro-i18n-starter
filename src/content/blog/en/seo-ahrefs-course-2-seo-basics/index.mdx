## SEO Fundamentals

### What Are the Benefits of SEO?

- SEO can drive more traffic to your site
- SEO can deliver consistent, ongoing traffic
- SEO traffic is essentially "free"

### How Do You Get Into Google's Rankings?

- Step one: Submit your sitemap to Google.
- Step two: Create a free Google Search Console account and submit your sitemap.

## Initial SEO Setup

SEO is an ongoing process -- the longer you do it well, the greater your chances of success over time.

### Choose a Good Domain Name

Some attributes of a good domain name: it is your company name, contains no hyphens, and is short and memorable.
Try to use a top-level domain such as .com, .org, etc.

### Choose a Website Platform

Hosted platforms handle everything in one place. They host your website, offer ready-made designs that are easy to install and customize, and allow you to create and manage content without touching code.

### Choose Quality Hosting

- **Security**: Make sure the hosting provider offers a free SSL/TLS certificate, or supports LetsEncrypt (a nonprofit organization that provides free TLS certificates).
- **Server location**: Data takes time to travel between the server and visitors, so it is best to choose a server location close to your target audience.
- **Technical support**: 24/7 support is ideal. Before signing up, test their support reliability by asking questions upfront.

### Create a Positive User Experience

- Use HTTPS
- Choose an attractive design
- Keep it mobile-friendly
- Use a readable font size
- Avoid intrusive pop-ups and ads
- Ensure fast loading speeds

### Create a Logical Site Structure

### Use a Logical URL Structure

If you are building a new website from scratch, it is best to use the clearest, most descriptive structure possible -- that means using the article title as the URL slug.
Using dates in URLs is also a bad practice, since you may want to update the article in the future.
If you are optimizing an existing website, it is generally best not to change the URL structure -- even if it is not ideal. Doing so could break other more important things and have an even greater negative impact on your SEO.

### Install a Good SEO Plugin

We use Yoast, but Rank Math is also a great option.

## How to Do SEO

### Keyword Research

- Find keywords
- Evaluate traffic potential
- Assess ranking difficulty

### On-Page SEO

On-page SEO involves creating the type of content that users are searching for and "optimizing" it to help search engines better understand what it is about.

- Match search intent
- Choose a descriptive URL slug
- Write compelling title tags
- Optimize images: give them meaningful file names, use descriptive alt text, and compress them

### Link Building

- **Guest blogging**: Write articles for other websites in exchange for backlinks.
- **Skyscraper technique**: Find relevant content with lots of backlinks, create something even better, then reach out and ask others to link to your content instead.
- **Track competitor links**: Understanding how your competitors attract backlinks is one of the best approaches to developing your own link building strategy.

### Technical SEO

We recommend signing up for a free Ahrefs Webmaster Tools account and scheduling regular crawls of your website. It will help you detect over 100 SEO issues, including many common technical problems.

## How to Track SEO Performance

### Monitor Share of Voice (SoV)

Organic share of voice measures how visible your brand is in search results.

### Track Changes Driven by Organic Traffic
