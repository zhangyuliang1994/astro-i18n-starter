### One: Your Personal Description in the Online Resume

The 200-character personal description in your online resume is important—write it carefully. The Boss backend uses this content to create tags, and HR will filter candidates based on these tags.

### Two: Actively Refresh

Your online resume needs to be polished every day. Actively update a few words daily to trigger the resume's automatic refresh.

### Three: Job Seeking Status

Select "Available to start immediately" or "Can start within the month while employed" as your job seeking status, as this will prioritize your profile for position recommendations.

### Four: Greetings

When greeting people on Boss, be sincere. Don't use the default prompt—it's too easy to repeat. Think of your own phrases that show your sincerity, enthusiasm, and appreciation. You don't need to use the automatic greeting feature.

### Five: Resume Visibility

Keeping your resume visible 24/7 every day isn't always ideal. You can set it to hide during evenings and weekends, and show during business hours.

### Six: Job Matching

Don't write abbreviations in your resume. Some HR personnel don't understand technology and only look at job matching—whether your resume contains matching technical keywords and required descriptions.

### Seven: Respond to HR

If HR reaches out to you, definitely respond. Don't just send a greeting and move on to the next one. If HR sends you even a single character of response, you can send your resume as an attachment through Boss. Also check daily to see which HR messages are waiting for your reply.

### Eight: Search for Positions

Some positions on Boss are recommended to you, but you shouldn't rely solely on recommended data. You should actively search for positions yourself—you'll discover many positions you haven't applied to yet. Your search terms can be technology, business, job title, or filter conditions.

### Nine: Value Interview Opportunities

Before or after submitting your resume, the job poster might ask if you're willing to switch to Go, accept business travel, or agree to certain conditions. It's not recommended to refuse. You should agree for now. After all, getting the job isn't decided in the first interview—there are second and third rounds, and you might not even pass the first one. In the early stage, what we need are interview opportunities, not the company's benefits and conditions.

### Ten: Take Initiative in Communication

For positions you've actively reached out about daily, try to follow up repeatedly. Sometimes when you respond again with a few more lines to a position, the HR person might shift from "seen but not replied" to actually replying. Don't think that just one greeting message is enough. You can go online for 100+ interactions daily—it's completely fine to follow up multiple times. When you're online, engage in sincere conversation again.
