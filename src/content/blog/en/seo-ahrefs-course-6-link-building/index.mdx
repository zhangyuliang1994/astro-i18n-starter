## 1. Link Building Fundamentals

As a general rule, pages with more backlinks tend to rank higher in search results.
If you have built a lot of links to your page but it still ranks poorly, investigate other factors that might be preventing you from ranking.

## 2. How to Build Links

### Add Links

- Submit to business directories
- Social media profile pages
- Blog comments
- Post on forums, communities, and Q&A sites
- Create job search listings

### Ask for Links

- Guest blogging -- create useful content for their website.
- Skyscraper technique -- show them a better resource than the one they are currently linking to.
- Link insertion -- show them a resource that provides more information about something they have mentioned.
- Ego bait -- mention them or their work in a positive light in your own content.
- Testimonials and case studies -- give positive feedback on their product or service.
- Link exchange -- offer to link to them if they agree to link to you.
- Resource page link building -- show them a resource that fits well with their existing resource page.
- Broken link building -- help them fix broken links on their pages by providing a replacement link.
- Image link building -- request proper attribution when your images are used.
- Unlinked mentions -- ask them to make mentions of your brand "clickable."
- Link changes -- request modifications to existing links pointing to your site.
- HARO and journalist requests -- provide an "expert quote" for their articles.
- PR -- give them a remarkable story.

### Buy Links

### Earn Links

### Maintain Links

1. Fix 404 pages that have high-quality backlinks.
2. Monitor your lost backlinks and contact the site owner when an important link is lost (also known as "link reclamation").

## 3. What Makes a Good Link

### Authority

### Relevance

Links from sites in the same niche as yours are considered to carry more value than links from unrelated sites.

### Anchor Text

"Anchor text" is the clickable text snippet that links to another page. In many cases, it concisely describes the content of the linked page.

### Nofollow vs. Follow

Generally speaking, you want to acquire "follow" links (i.e., links without any nofollow-type attributes), since these links should carry the most voting power.
However, if you see an opportunity to get a "nofollow" link from a relevant, high-authority page, you should absolutely go for it.

### Placement

### Destination

When building links to your site, there are three types of destinations:

1. Your homepage
2. Linkable assets
3. The actual pages you need to rank well in Google.

## 4. Best Link Building Strategies

### Pursue Competitor Links

### Create Linkable Assets

Study your competitors' websites to see if they have any linkable assets you can draw inspiration from.

### Content Promotion

1. Influencers and communities
2. Advertising
3. Build an audience

- Ask them to subscribe to your email list
- Ask them to follow you on Twitter/LinkedIn/Instagram/TikTok
- Invite them to join your private community on Slack/Discord/Facebook
- Retarget them with Facebook/Twitter/Google ads

### Guest Blogging

## 5. Link Building Tools

- Ahrefs Webmaster Tools -- shows all links currently pointing to your own site and lets you sort and filter them by many important SEO metrics.
- Ahrefs Free Backlink Checker -- shows the top 100 links pointing to any website or URL.
- Google Alerts -- notifies you whenever a specific word or phrase is mentioned on a newly published page. This is a great way to find quality link opportunities.
