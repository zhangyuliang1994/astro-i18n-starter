> I'm Boris and I created Claude Code. Lots of people have asked how I use Claude Code, so I wanted to show off my setup a bit.

My setup might be surprisingly vanilla! Claude Code works great out of the box, so I personally don't customize it much. There is no one correct way to use Claude Code: we intentionally build it in a way that you can use it, customize it, and hack it however you like. Each person on the Claude Code team uses it very differently.

So, here goes.

---

## 1. Run 5 Claudes in Parallel

I run 5 Claudes in parallel in my terminal. I number my tabs 1-5, and use system notifications to know when a Claude needs input.

📖 [iTerm2 System Notifications](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-config#iterm-2-system-notifications)

---

## 2. Local + Web Parallel Collaboration

I also run 5-10 Claudes on [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code), in parallel with my local Claudes.

![Web Sessions List](/images/blog/boris-claude-code-tips/cc-2.jpeg)

As I code in my terminal, I will often:
- Hand off local sessions to web (using `&`)
- Manually kick off sessions in Chrome
- Sometimes `--teleport` back and forth

I also start a few sessions from my phone (from the Claude iOS app) every morning and throughout the day, and check in on them later.

---

## 3. Always Use Opus 4.5 + Thinking

I use **Opus 4.5 with thinking** for everything. It's the best coding model I've ever used, and even though it's bigger & slower than Sonnet, since you have to steer it less and it's better at tool use, it is almost always faster than using a smaller model in the end.

---

## 4. Team-Shared CLAUDE.md

Our team shares a single `CLAUDE.md` for the Claude Code repo. We check it into git, and the whole team contributes multiple times a week.

![CLAUDE.md Example](/images/blog/boris-claude-code-tips/cc-4.jpeg)

**Key Practice**: Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly, we add it to the `CLAUDE.md`, so Claude knows not to do it next time.

Other teams maintain their own `CLAUDE.md`'s. It is each team's job to keep theirs up to date.

---

## 5. Use @claude in Code Review

During code review, I will often tag `@claude` on my coworkers' PRs to add something to the `CLAUDE.md` as part of the PR.

![Claude Updating CLAUDE.md](/images/blog/boris-claude-code-tips/cc-5.jpeg)

We use the Claude Code GitHub Action (`/install-github-action`) for this. It's our version of **Compounding Engineering**.

---

## 6. Most Sessions Start in Plan Mode

Most sessions start in **Plan mode** (`Shift + Tab` twice).

![Plan Mode](/images/blog/boris-claude-code-tips/cc-6.png)

If my goal is to write a Pull Request, I will:
1. Use Plan mode
2. Go back and forth with Claude until I like its plan
3. Switch into auto-accept edits mode
4. Claude can usually 1-shot it from there

![Auto-Edit Mode](/images/blog/boris-claude-code-tips/cc-1.jpeg)

**A good plan is really important!**

---

## 7. Use Slash Commands for Repetitive Workflows

I use slash commands for every "inner loop" workflow that I end up doing many times a day. This saves me from repeated prompting, and makes it so Claude can use these workflows, too.

Commands are checked into git and live in `.claude/commands/`.

![Slash Command Example](/images/blog/boris-claude-code-tips/cc-7.jpeg)

**Example**: Claude and I use a `/commit-push-pr` slash command dozens of times every day. The command uses inline bash to pre-compute git status and a few other pieces of info to make the command run quickly and avoid back-and-forth with the model.

📖 [Bash Command Execution](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands#bash-command-execution)

---

## 8. Use Subagents Regularly

I use a few subagents regularly:

| Subagent | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `code-simplifier` | Simplifies the code after Claude is done working |
| `verify-app` | Has detailed instructions for testing Claude Code end to end |

![Agents Directory Structure](/images/blog/boris-claude-code-tips/cc-8.png)

Similar to slash commands, I think of subagents as automating the most common workflows that I do for most PRs.

📖 [Subagents Documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents)

---

## 9. Use PostToolUse Hook for Code Formatting

We use a **PostToolUse hook** to format Claude's code.

![Hooks Configuration Example](/images/blog/boris-claude-code-tips/cc-9.jpeg)

Claude usually generates well-formatted code out of the box, and the hook handles the last 10% to avoid formatting errors in CI later.

---

## 10. Pre-Allow Commands Instead of Skipping Permissions

I don't use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Instead, I use `/permissions` to pre-allow common bash commands that I know are safe in my environment, to avoid unnecessary permission prompts.

![Permissions Configuration Interface](/images/blog/boris-claude-code-tips/cc-10.jpeg)

Most of these are checked into `.claude/settings.json` and shared with the team.

---

## 11. Claude Code Uses All My Tools

Claude Code uses all my tools for me:

- Searches and posts to **Slack** (via the MCP server)
- Runs **BigQuery** queries to answer analytics questions (using bq CLI)
- Grabs error logs from **Sentry**
- And more...

![MCP Configuration Example](/images/blog/boris-claude-code-tips/cc-11.jpeg)

The Slack MCP configuration is checked into our `.mcp.json` and shared with the team.

---

## 12. Handle Long-Running Tasks

For very long-running tasks, I will either:

1. Prompt Claude to verify its work with a background agent when it's done
2. Use an **Agent Stop Hook** to do that more deterministically
3. Use the [ralph-wiggum plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum)

I will also use either `--permission-mode=dontAsk` or `--dangerously-skip-permissions` in a sandbox to avoid permission prompts for the session, so Claude can cook without being blocked on me.

## 13. Most Important Tip: Give Claude a Way to Verify Its Work

Probably the most important thing to get great results out of Claude Code — **give Claude a way to verify its work**.

If Claude has that feedback loop, it will **2-3x the quality** of the final result.

Claude tests every single change I land to claude.ai/code using the Claude Chrome extension. It opens a browser, tests the UI, and iterates until the code works and the UX feels good.

**Verification looks different for each domain**:
- It might be as simple as running a bash command
- Or running a test suite
- Or testing the app in a browser or phone simulator

Make sure to invest in making this rock-solid.
