After writing about twenty articles with Hexo, I found it sometimes quite troublesome.

At the beginning, writing markdown, pushing it, and watching GitHub Actions run was quite exciting, but over time, it became tedious.

A few days ago, I tried writing two articles on Yuque, and the online editor was quite useful, but syncing to Hexo was too cumbersome.

Moreover, neither Yuque nor Notion have local storage, which makes me, a conservative, very anxious.

I finally chose Obsidian. It has basically no learning curve, and the desktop client editor is very user-friendly. With git set to commit on a schedule, I don't need to constantly think about committing code and can focus on the content itself.

Mainly referenced this blog:

And this one:

In addition to this, I also made two changes:

- Changed images from local storage to MinIO
- Installed the `RemotelySync` plugin on both mobile and desktop to facilitate syncing to mobile for viewing, using Jianguoyun's Webdav.
