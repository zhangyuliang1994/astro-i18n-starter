**How to Use**: Use the `@` symbol to specify files directly

---

## 4. Deep Thinking

**Use Case**: When facing difficult problems, planning solutions, refactoring code, or solving complex bugs

**How to Use**: Use keywords like `ultrathink` or `think deeply` in your prompts

---

## 5. Plan Mode

**Use Case**: When planning projects in early stages or solving complex issues

**How to Use**: Press `Shift + Tab` twice to see this option

It will ask if you want to continue:
- If unsatisfied, choose **No** and continue explaining your requirements
- If it looks good, choose **Yes** and it will start working

**Location**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

### 8.2 Project Memory File

**Location**: `CLAUDE.md` file in your project directory

> 💡 For existing projects with code, it's recommended to use the `/init` command to auto-generate

---

## 9. Use Previous Message Prompts

**Use Case**: When you want to restore a previous conversation

**How to Use**: Press `Esc` twice

---

## 10. How to Restore Code

**Use Case**: When you regret the code changes and want to revert

**How to Use**:
- Directly ask Claude Code to roll back to the previous version
- Or use Git to revert versions

---

## 11. Resume Conversation / View Chat History

**How to Use**:

```bash
# Use /resume command
/resume

# Or use these flags
claude -c  # Continue last conversation
claude -r  # Resume conversation
```

---

## 12. Execute Terminal Commands

**Use Case**: Check current directory or execute special commands

**How to Use**: Use `!` (exclamation mark) to enter command mode

```bash
# Check current directory
! pwd

# List files
! ll
```

---

## 13. Monitor Usage

```bash
# Check usage
npx ccusage@latest

# Real-time usage monitoring
npx ccusage@latest blocks --live
```

---

## 14. Background Service

**Use Case**: When completing features, Claude Code usually starts a service for accessing interfaces or UI. Without background service capability, Claude Code stays stuck on the service startup screen, preventing other conversation needs.

**How to Use**: `Ctrl + B`

---

## 15. Other Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Function |
|----------|----------|
| `Ctrl + J` | New line |
| `Ctrl + B` | Background service |
| `Shift + Tab` | Switch modes (once for auto-edit, twice for Plan mode) |
| `Esc` × 2 | Use previous message prompts |

---

## Summary

Mastering these Claude Code techniques can significantly boost your AI programming efficiency:

- **Basic Commands**: Familiarize yourself with `/clear`, `/compact`, `/status`, etc.
- **Shortcuts**: Make good use of `Shift + Tab`, `Ctrl + B`, etc.
