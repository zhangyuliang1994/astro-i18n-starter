## I. Overview

The best time to plant a tree was ten years ago, the second best time is now.

The advanced course is the second lesson for beginners, detailing how novices can build websites. Just follow instructions.

Building a website is a long-term accumulation process and a process of continuous growth, so I decided to launch 20 websites this year.

## II. Main Content

### General Process

#### Demand Mining

Demand mining is likely the hardest part; finding real demand is crucial.

1. Use root words to search on data platforms, then filter conditions to find suitable keywords.
2. Use Google Trends to search keywords and get more related keywords.
3. Analyze some large sites, analyze their keywords, and find keywords that bring them new traffic.
4. Use advertising data to see which keywords large sites are bidding on, indicating these keywords are valuable and profitable.
5. Use search engine keyword recommendations, input root words to get recommendations, and find keywords frequently searched by users.

#### Development

AI + Template: I currently purchased mksass templates, built a few websites, and feel it is quite convenient.

#### Domain

1. Suffix suggestions: .com, .ai, .net, .org, etc., try to be mainstream.
2. Registrar recommendations: cloudflare, spaceship. Do NOT recommend namesilo (was pitted last year).

#### Post-Launch Actions

GSC, GA: Submit to Google Search Console, add Google Analytics.

#### Promotion / Backlink Building

Backlinks also need long-term accumulation, constantly updating your backlink library.

1. **Start with familiar channels**: Start with channels you are familiar with and can influence, post everywhere. Get the first batch of users, even if not overseas users, because they can help find bugs.
2. **Submit to Weekly/Aggregation Sites**: Then submit to some newsletters, like Ruanyifeng's Weekly, ahhhhfs.com, etc.
3. **Submit to ProductHunt**: Afterwards, submit the product to ProductHunt to bring the first wave of real overseas users. Since our product is an AI tool, it will be automatically crawled by various AI navigation spiders from PH, thus gaining a batch of users from these navigation sites.
4. **Submit to Navigation Sites**: Then manually submit to AI navigation sites that don't auto-crawl. Pay for some if affordable. At this step, observe user usage.
5. **Submit to Tech Media**: If results are good, find small tech media/self-media for self-recommendation.
6. **Find people with needs on social platforms**: Finally, search on Twitter for people looking for related products, reply to recommend your product sincerely.

#### Deployment

Use Vercel for the early stage, simplest and most convenient.

Use CloudFlare family bucket after having some foundation.

### Tools

Semrush, Google trends, AITDK plugin, etc.

I bought Semrush for a year on Taobao. Google Trends and AITDK are free.

## III. Summary

Gefei suggested a 4-2-4 time allocation for demand finding, development, and promotion. 40% on demand, 20% on dev, 40% on promotion. This is counter-intuitive for developers, but we must accept reality and step out of the developer identity.
