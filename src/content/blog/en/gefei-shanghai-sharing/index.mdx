# Gefei Shanghai Offline Sharing: From Beginner to Practice

After attending a local Shengcai offline event, my biggest takeaway was "chatting online a thousand times is not as good as meeting offline once." As a beginner, I definitely need to attend more offline events. Gefei's mid-year sharing had a Shanghai venue, just over an hour by high-speed rail from Nanjing, so I headed to the train station right after work on Friday.

## 1. Overview

Gefei focuses on overseas websites, and this event naturally revolved around this theme. The Shanghai venue wasn't large, with capacity for only 150 people, and Gefei limited the spots to community members only. Despite heavy rain in Shanghai that day, it didn't dampen the enthusiasm of community members, with many arriving two hours early, including many from out of town, especially from Hangzhou. The event exceeded my expectations, particularly guest Kajiwa, who shared beginner-friendly experience in a stand-up comedy style, completely electrifying the audience.

## 2. Sharing Topics

Besides Gefei, there were 7 guest speakers. The event exceeded expectations and ran over schedule, so while Gefei was the finale, he didn't speak much, giving more time to the guests.

### Beginner-Friendly Sessions

Two guests' shares were particularly friendly to beginners: Kajiwa and BingNi.

#### Kajiwa - Let's Talk About Website Launch

Kajiwa was absolutely the MVP of this event. His sharing resonated so well that community members created mind maps which spread widely, even Gefei shared about it on his social media.

**Key Points:**

**Basic Requirements:**
- Development basics: CRUD, API calls
- Financial investment: mainstream domains (com, ai, org, net), backlinks, API services, servers
- Patience!!!

**Website Type Selection:**
- AI tool sites
- Avoid heavy operations: goal is passive income
- Don't do brand keywords: risks shutdown and payment issues
- Don't do overly complex features: simple and vertical

**Keywords and Domains:**
- Use first-hand information sources to register domains early
- If keywords are taken, look at derived long-tail keywords
- Long-tail keyword advantages: precise, high conversion, less competition (suitable for beginners)

**How to Launch Quickly:**
- Buy templates, modify them, gradually make them your own
- Refuse to write code from scratch (especially if you don't know frontend)
- Launch first, iterate with users

#### BingNi - Important Things to Earn Your First Bucket of Gold Overseas

This guy is also impressive - joined Tencent as a backend developer right after graduating in 2021, quit in 2023, and after just 1.5 years of practice, achieved excellent results.

**Finding Needs:**
- Follow new keywords via Google Trends, Twitter, Replicate, and Hugging Face

**Building Websites:**
- Quick start is most important: get a template, keep it simple
- Focus on user experience: simple interaction, stability, rich features, free trials

**Getting Traffic:**
- SEO and backlinks
- Submit to AI tool directories

### Product Experience

Three guests shared their product experiences, though as a beginner I couldn't absorb much. However, guest Yang Jian'ang was truly exceptional, spending over an hour discussing their startup journey and products, with half the content in English.

### SEO and Advertising

The final two guests covered SEO content systems and KOL advertising for small-budget teams. As a beginner, I found these topics difficult to grasp but hope to reach this level in the future.

## 3. Summary

What impressed me most about this event was Kajiwa. Unlike other guests with impressive credentials, he doesn't have a prestigious school or big company background. Similar to me, he's a Java developer with 5-6 years of experience, a CRUD Boy who just calls APIs. He gave ordinary people like me hope - achieving excellent results in just 1.5 years (already in the $10k/month club). I may not be able to invest as much time and energy as him every day, but with steady daily progress and persistence, I'll achieve my own results too. Keep going!
