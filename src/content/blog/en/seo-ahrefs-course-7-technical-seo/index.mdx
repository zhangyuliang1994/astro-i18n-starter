## 1. Technical SEO Fundamentals

Technical SEO is the process of optimizing your website to help search engines like Google find, crawl, understand, and index your pages. The goal is to make your site discoverable by search engines and improve your rankings.

## 2. Understanding Crawling

The robots.txt file tells search engines which pages they can and cannot access.
Every website has a different crawl budget, which is a combination of how frequently Google crawls your site and how much crawling your site allows.

## 3. Understanding Indexing

A crawler directive is an HTML snippet that tells search engines how to crawl or index a specific page. It is placed in the head section of a webpage.

The easiest way to see how Google has indexed a page is by using the URL Inspection tool in Google Search Console. It will show you what Google has selected as the canonical URL.

## 4. Quick Wins for Technical SEO

One of the hardest things about SEO is prioritization.
You can check the visibility report in Site Audit to find pages that cannot be indexed and understand why. This report is available for free in Ahrefs Webmaster Tools.

Internal links are links from one page on your site to another page on your site. They help search engines discover your pages and help those pages rank better.

Hreflang is an HTML attribute used to specify the language and geographic targeting of a webpage. If you have multiple versions of the same page in different languages, you can use hreflang tags to inform search engines like Google about these variants. This helps them serve the correct version to users.

## 5. Additional Technical Factors

## 6. Technical SEO Tools

Google Search Console is a free service provided by Google that helps you monitor and troubleshoot your website's performance in search results.
Use it to find and fix technical errors, submit sitemaps, review structured data issues, and more.
Bing and Yandex also have their own tools, as does Ahrefs. Ahrefs Webmaster Tools is a free tool that helps you improve your website's SEO performance. It allows you to:

- Find internal linking opportunities
- It fills the gaps left by Google Search Console's limitations.
