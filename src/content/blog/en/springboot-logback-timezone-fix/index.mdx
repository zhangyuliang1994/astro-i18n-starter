### 1. Problem

The logback log time doesn't match the system time, always differing by several hours. Setting the project timezone didn't help, and `new Date()` in the project shows the correct time.

### 2. Cause

The same project is deployed on two machines. The time was normal on the previous machine, but not on this one. The specific cause hasn't been found yet.

### 3. Solution

Modify the time format in the logback configuration file pattern

**Before modification:**

```xml
<property name="pattern" value="%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss:SSS} %thread [%level] %m%n"/>
```

**After modification:**

```xml
<property name="pattern" value="%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss:SSS,CTT} %thread [%level] %m%n"/>
```

Add a specified timezone after `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS`, separated by a comma. For example, `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS,CTT`. CTT represents Shanghai time. After this change, it works correctly.
