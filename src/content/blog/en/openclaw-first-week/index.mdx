> A month ago, X was flooded with OpenClaw posts. I wanted to try it, but it looked token-hungry, so I delayed. During Spring Festival, I installed it on my Mac mini, but the free Codex quota ran out quickly, and it was basically unusable.

## 1. Why I Installed OpenClaw
On X (Twitter), there were many posts praising OpenClaw. But I had been using Claude Code for a long time, and I felt most things "little lobster" could do were already doable in CC, so I had some bias against it.

Today was the first working day after the holiday. Our VP gave the usual kickoff talk, and unexpectedly the opening topic was OpenClaw. I got excited and decided to try it seriously.

## 2. What I’m Using It For Right Now
I installed it on my MacBook Pro, using OpenAI Codex as the model and Feishu as the third-party app channel.

### 2.1 Writing Blog Posts
At first, I wasn’t sure what to do with it. So I gave it simple tasks: help me work on blog posts.

I gave it my blog project path and deployed site, asked it to make a few edits, and it worked pretty well.

### 2.2 Monitoring Sitemap
I gave it a GitHub repo for sitemap monitoring, asked it to clone into its own workspace, and adapt it to my needs.

It created scheduled tasks for itself and now pushes updates to our Feishu group regularly.

### 2.3 Installing Skills
I asked it to install several skills I use often, so they’re ready for future tasks.

#### 2.4 Other
Since I subscribed to ChatGPT Plus, I still have plenty of token budget left. Tomorrow I plan to reinstall on Mac mini and put two little lobsters in one group:

- One named **Pipi Shrimp**, on MacBook, responsible for evaluating all my requests and assigning work.
- One named **Papa Shrimp**, on Mac mini. When Pipi is offline, Papa becomes the leader.

## 3. Summary
OpenClaw can keep conversation history and save important information into markdown files, which helps avoid losing key context later.

Recently, Sun Ge also said on X that we should chat more with AI. Don’t touch all of his projects, but his advice here is worth listening to.
