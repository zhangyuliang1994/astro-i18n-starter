### I. Windows

Use the WinSW tool, download from: https://github.com/winsw/winsw/releases

#### 1.1 Create a new folder directory with any name. Place your JAR file and the downloaded WinSW.exe tool in this folder

Rename WinSW.exe to myJava-service.exe

#### 1.2 Create an XML configuration file

```xml
<service>
  <id>myJava</id>
  <name>myJava</name>
  <description>This service runs myJava continuous integration system.</description>
  <executable>java</executable>
  <arguments>-Xrs -Xmx256m -jar "%BASE%\jenkins.jar"</arguments>
</service>
```

Save the configuration file with the same name as in step 1, myJava-service.xml

#### 1.3 Install the service

Open cmd in the current directory and execute `myJava-service.exe install`

If the command line window displays a message similar to "successfully", the installation is successful.

At this point, open `Services`, and you should see a background service named `myJava` with startup type set to `Automatic`, which will auto-start by default on boot.

### II. Linux

#### 2.1 Create a service file

```shell
cd /etc/systemd/system
touch myapp.service
```

#### 2.2 Configure the service file

vi /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service

```shell
[Unit]
Description=My Spring Boot Application
After=syslog.target
[Service]
User=your-username
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar /path/to/your/application.jar
SuccessExitStatus=143
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save and close the file. Make sure to replace "your-username" and "/path/to/your/application.jar" with the actual username and application path.

#### 2.3 Install the service

Reload the Systemd configuration file so it can recognize the new service file:

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Start the service and set it to auto-start:

```shell
sudo systemctl start myapp.service
sudo systemctl enable myapp.service
```

You can use the following commands to stop or restart the service:

```shell
sudo systemctl stop myapp.service
sudo systemctl restart myapp.service
```
