### 1. Common Commands

#### 1.1 Create New Post

```shell
hexo new [layout] <title>
```

e.g.

```shell
hexo new "post title with whitespace"
```

#### 1.2 Create Post in Subdirectory

By default, new files are created in the `_posts` directory. When you have many posts, it's inconvenient to find them. You can create a directory under `_posts`, such as `dir`, then use the following command to create a post in the `_posts/dir` directory:

```shell
hexo new -p dir/test -s "test" "测试"
# test is the post filename
# 测试 is the post title

# -p, --path	Customize the path for new post
# -s, --slug	Post slug, used as filename and URL after publication
```

### 2. Common Syntax

#### 2.1 Internal Post Linking

```text
{% post_link Post Title %}
```

e.g.

```text
{% post_link nginx-common-commands %}
```

> **Note**: `{% post_link %}` is Hexo-specific tag syntax. In Astro/MDX, you need to use Markdown link syntax, for example: `[nginx-common-commands](/en/blog/nginx-common-commands/)`

#### 2.2 Pin Single Post

```yaml
sticky: 1
```

> **Note**: `sticky` is a Hexo frontmatter field. In Astro, you can implement similar functionality through custom fields.

#### 2.3 Collapsible Content

In Hexo, use the `<details>` tag for collapsing:

```html
<details><summary>Summary content</summary>

(Leave a blank line above) This is the actual content to be expanded.
</details>
```

Or use the `{% spoiler %}` tag:

```text
{% spoiler Answer %}
Reference answer
{% endspoiler %}

{% spoiler "Several spaces in the title" %}
content
{% endspoiler %}
```

> **Note**: `{% spoiler %}` is Hexo-specific tag syntax. In Astro/MDX, you can use the HTML `<details>` tag to achieve the same collapsing effect.
