## SEO content basics

### What is SEO content

SEO content is content designed to rank in search engines. It could be a blog post, product or landing page, interactive tool, or something else.

### Why is SEO content important

Not all content ranks and gets traffic from organic search. Only content crafted for searchers about topics they're searching for does (unless you get lucky).

## How to create SEO content

Crafting SEO content is about giving searchers what they want and making it "sticky." If you can share unique insights and expertise on top of that, even better.

### Choose a proven topic

### Analyze search intent

Understanding search intent means figuring out what the searcher is looking for. You need to do this because your chances of ranking are slim if your content doesn't align with it.
In most situations, your content should take a similar approach to the content that already ranks well (similar, but not identical—more on that below). Once you're happy that you're giving searchers what they want, it's time for the nitty-gritty of on-page SEO.

### Check your expertise

### Cover the topic in full

If you've got expertise covered, it's time to create the type of content searchers want to see. Analyzing search intent gives you a high-level idea of this, but it doesn't reveal all.

### Make it unique

### Make it "sticky"

Here are a few tips for making content more "sticky":

- Keep it simple. Avoid complex words and sentences.
- Make it visual. Break up walls of text with images and videos.
- Speak your audience's language. Use terms and jargon that resonate with readers.
- Boss your spelling. Run a spell check; it makes all the difference.

### Keep it evergreen

Content doesn't stay fresh forever. That's an issue if you're targeting a fast-moving topic. It means you'll have to work to keep your content updated to keep Google and searchers happy.
