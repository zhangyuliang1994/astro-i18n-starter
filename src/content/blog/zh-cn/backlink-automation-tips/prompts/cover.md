# Cover Image Prompt

Create a clean, conceptual cover image for an article about blog comment backlink automation.

## Visual Concept

A minimalist conceptual illustration showing the journey from manual to automated link building:

- **Center**: A stylized chain link icon or interconnected nodes representing backlinks, with a subtle gradient from blue to teal
- **Left side**: A simplified hand icon or human silhouette, representing manual work and hands-on practice
- **Right side**: A small gear/cog or robot arm icon, representing automation
- **Between them**: A gentle arrow or flow line connecting manual → automated, suggesting progression
- **Background**: Clean, light cool-toned gradient (light blue to white), with subtle grid or dot pattern for tech feel

## Style

- Flat vector style with clean geometric shapes
- Cool palette: blues, teals, light grays
- Minimal detail — shapes should be simple and iconic
- 40-60% whitespace for breathing room
- No realistic humans — use simplified silhouettes or icons only

## Title

Display the title "博客评论外链自动化的正确姿势" in clean sans-serif font, positioned at the bottom or center of the image. The text should be dark (near-black or dark blue) for readability against the light background.

## Dimensions

1792 x 1024 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio)
